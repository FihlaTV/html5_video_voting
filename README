h1. HTML5 Video Voting

h2. What is this HTML5 Video Voting you speak of?

This is an experiment with HTML5 Video that allows you to vote on your favorite segments of the video and view trends in a real-time bar graph. The source code is setup to accept any key event as a vote, you just have to define it in your jQuery embed code. The default vote submission key is the space bar.

h3. Back-end required

You will need a backend to receive and process your votes. Votes must be returned as a tally of all the votes for each column you want to display. In our experiment on http://www.zurb.com/playground/html5-video-voting we are using Ruby on Rails to process the votes into the designated number of columns.
